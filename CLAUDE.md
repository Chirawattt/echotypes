# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Dev server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack for faster builds)
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Production**: `npm start`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`

## Project Architecture

### Core Application Structure

This is an English vocabulary learning game built with Next.js 15 using the App Router. The application features multiple game modes for practicing English vocabulary with different CEFR difficulty levels (A1-C2).

### Key Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with Auth0/Google providers
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Speech**: Web Speech API for text-to-speech
- **Sounds**: Custom audio system with Web Audio API

### Game Architecture

The application revolves around three main game modes:

1. **Echo Mode**: Listen and type what you hear
2. **Memory Mode**: Memorize words, then recall them 
3. **Typing Mode**: Fast-paced typing practice with WPM tracking

Each mode supports:
- **Practice Mode**: Relaxed learning with no time limits
- **Challenge Mode**: Competitive scoring with time pressure
- **DDA (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment)**: Adaptive difficulty based on performance

### Route Structure

```
/                           # Homepage
/play                       # Game mode selection
/play/{modeId}              # Difficulty selection  
/play/{modeId}/{difficultyId}/pre-game   # Game setup
/play/{modeId}/{difficultyId}/game       # Actual gameplay
/play/{modeId}/dda          # DDA mode selection
/play/{modeId}/dda/play     # DDA gameplay
```

**Mode IDs**: `echo`, `memory`, `typing`
**Difficulty IDs**: `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `c1`, `c2`, `dda`

### State Management

The application uses a centralized Zustand store (`lib/stores/gameStore.ts`) that manages:

- Game status (countdown, playing, gameOver)
- Word lists and current word index
- Scoring system with streak tracking
- Lives and timer states
- Mode-specific statistics
- DDA performance tracking
- Challenge mode scoring

### Custom Hooks Architecture

The game logic is modularized into specialized hooks in the `hooks/` directory:

- `useGameLogic`: Main orchestrator hook
- `useGameModes`: Mode-specific behaviors (echo/memory/typing)
- `useGameEvents`: Input handling and word validation
- `useGameScore`: Scoring calculations for challenge modes
- `useGameTimers`: Timer management for different modes
- `useDDA`: Dynamic difficulty adjustment logic
- `useAudio`: Sound effects management
- `useSpeech`: Text-to-speech functionality
- `useNitroEnergy`: Energy system for typing challenge mode
- `useOverdriveSystem`: Heat level system for typing challenge mode

### Word Management

Words are now stored in Supabase database and fetched dynamically:
- Words table contains vocabulary organized by CEFR levels (A1-C2)
- Words include English text, type (noun/verb/etc.), and meanings
- API endpoint `/api/words` handles word fetching with level filtering
- DDA system (`lib/ddaWords.ts`) uses caching for performance
- `lib/wordsService.ts` provides service functions for database operations

### Scoring System

Two scoring approaches:
1. **Practice Mode**: Simple word count tracking
2. **Challenge Mode**: Complex scoring in `lib/scoring.ts` that factors in:
   - Time efficiency
   - Streak bonuses
   - Difficulty multipliers
   - Mode-specific bonuses

### Authentication & Data

- User authentication via NextAuth.js (`providers/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Score persistence to Supabase database
- Local storage for high scores and preferences
- API routes in `app/api/` for score submission and auth

### Component Organization

```
components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game/           # Game-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/         # Navigation and layout
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Reusable UI components (shadcn/ui based)
```

### Important Development Notes

- Game state is preserved across route navigation using Zustand
- Speech synthesis must be cancelled before starting new games
- Audio preloading is handled in custom audio hooks
- Mobile-specific virtual keyboard support for better UX
- The app supports both Thai and English text for multilingual users
- DDA system tracks performance independently of the main scoring
- Challenge mode uses completely different scoring logic than practice mode

### Database Schema

The app expects a Supabase database with score tracking tables. Check `database/schema.sql` for the required structure.

### Configuration Files

- TypeScript config uses path aliases (`@/*` points to root)
- ESLint extends Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript rules
- Next.js config disables React strict mode for game compatibility

### Testing Approach

Currently no automated tests are configured. Testing should focus on:
- Game logic accuracy across different modes
- Score calculation correctness
- DDA system behavior
- Cross-browser audio/speech compatibility

- Add remaining UI enhancements for better user experience

### another requirement
- also re-design a pre-game page
- add more information about how to play the game in each mode.
- also redesign a countdown page too.
- also a gameplaypage too.
- i want to delete dda directory it's not necessary also rename a DdaGamePlayPage to GamePlayPage
- about gameplaypage i want a notification that user was level changed up or down at bottom of Level (A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,C1) so appear and diappear smoothly.
- about the challenge score i want to add the animation or something that change the number smoothly not the wrap one but not add too much it will be lagging.
- about GameInput i want after user submit answer then suddenly block it so the users can't spam the answer anyways.
- about Typing Challenge mode i want a text or something that tell the user how many points has increase or decrease after submit.
- about Memory Challenge mode which will decrease display words time so i want some text that notify user how many time will display the words. (display all time not disappear)

- implemeted Leaderboard.
- Optimize code | Refactor | Clean up code
- Do a testing
- CI/CD
- Deploy
- End Project.
